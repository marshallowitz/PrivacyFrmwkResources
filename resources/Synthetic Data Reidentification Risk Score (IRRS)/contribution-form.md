Contributor Notes:
This contribution provides a heuristic metric — the IRRS (Synthetic Data Reidentification Risk Score) — to estimate reidentification risk in AI-generated synthetic datasets without requiring access to the original data. It is conceptually aligned with the NIST Privacy Framework and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, but it is not a normative assessment tool and does not replace formal privacy guarantees such as differential privacy.
The resource is intended to support practitioners in privacy engineering, impact assessments, and AI governance by offering an interpretable and transparent risk-estimation approach.
