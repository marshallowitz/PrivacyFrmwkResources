**Contributor Notes:** TThe Synthetic Data Reidentification Risk Score (IRRS) is a heuristic risk estimation framework designed to support organizations in assessing residual reidentification risks in AI-generated synthetic datasets. The IRRS estimates three primary dimensions of risk, membership inference, attribute inference, and singling-out, and provides an aggregated risk score without requiring access to the original dataset.

The IRRS is conceptually aligned with the NIST Privacy Framework and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, helping implementers reason about privacy risks in data synthesis, model training, and data release contexts. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable and is intended for practitioners in privacy engineering, AI governance, and impact assessment.

The IRRS is not a normative assessment method and does not replace formal privacy guarantees such as differential privacy or compliance assessments. Instead, it is meant to complement organizational risk management activities by offering a structured, explainable scoring approach for synthetic data scenarios across multiple sectors, including healthcare, finance, government, and education.
