**Contributor Notes:** This contribution provides a heuristic metric (IRRS – Synthetic Data Reidentification Risk Score) to estimate reidentification risk in AI-generated synthetic datasets without requiring access to the original data. It is aligned conceptually with the NIST Privacy Framework and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, but it is not a normative assessment tool nor a substitute for formal privacy guarantees such as differential privacy. The goal is to support practitioners in privacy engineering, impact assessment, and AI governance by offering an interpretable and transparent risk-estimation framework.
